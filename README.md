# SK8-RB5V2A4-001
Skateworx 5V Boost regulator

I was faced with a few projects that required Lithium Ion batteries but needed a decent 5V power rail to run my electronics. This was my use case for designing the SK8-RB5V2A4-001 boost regulator module. The core is a Texas Instruments TPS61230A boost regulator. This regulator has the ability of switching up to 6A internally.

The Design was done with Dip-trace.

Added two M3 mounting holes to make it easier to mount.

NOTE -HIGH CURRENT USE-
The TPS61230A dissipates its heat via the ground plane. If you are using this where you drawing anything above 800mA i would suggest to mount a 10mm x 10mm or 14mm x 14mm adhesive heatsink to the bottom on the PCB. this will ensure proper heat dissipation in high current applications.

As a precaution use 100uF capacitors on the input and output at high currents.

Specifications
Input Voltage range : 2.5v - 4.5v
Output Voltage : 5V
